🚀 PayPal Clone – Backend (Microservices Architecture)

A production-style Fintech payment wallet system inspired by PayPal, built using Spring Boot Microservices, following the PayPal Clone Series by Mrunmai Dahare.
This project simulates real-world payment flows: wallet creation, holds, captures, debits, credits, rewards, notifications, and transaction management — all using event-driven architecture with Kafka.

🧩 Microservices Included
Service	Responsibility
User Service	User registration, login, JWT authentication
Wallet Service	Wallet creation, credit, debit, hold & capture flow
Transaction Service	Stores transaction history & interacts with Wallet
Reward Service	Reward points logic for successful payments
Notification Service	Sends email/notification events
API Gateway	Single-entry routing, authentication, service forwarding
Discovery Service (Optional)	Eureka/Service registry
Kafka	Event-driven communication between services
